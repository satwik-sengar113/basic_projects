          <h3>Early Life and Education:</h3>
          <p>
            Born in Varanasi on November 19, 1828, Manikarnika Tambe, later
            known as Rani Lakshmi Bai, grew up in an environment that nurtured
            her sense of valor and independence. She received a comprehensive
            education, which was uncommon for girls of her time. She mastered
            various martial skills, horseback riding, and became well-versed in
            literature and administration, owing much of her education to her
            progressive father, Moropant Tambe.
          </p>
          <h3>Marriage and Ascension to the Throne:</h3>
          <p>
            At the age of 14, Manikarnika was married to the Maharaja of Jhansi,
            Raja Gangadhar Rao, and became Rani Lakshmi Bai of Jhansi. The
            couple shared a strong bond, and she actively participated in the
            affairs of the state, eventually ruling Jhansi after her husband's
            demise. However, her legitimacy as a ruler was challenged by the
            British East India Company, who sought to annex Jhansi under the
            Doctrine of Lapse.
          </p>
          <h3>The Warrior Queen:</h3>
          <p>
            Rani Lakshmi Bai's defining moment came in 1857 when the First War
            of Indian Independence, also known as the Sepoy Mutiny, erupted. She
            fearlessly led her troops into battle against the British forces,
            donning a soldier's attire and riding into the forefront of combat
            on horseback. Her strategic acumen, unmatched courage, and
            willingness to risk her life for her people quickly earned her
            respect and admiration.
